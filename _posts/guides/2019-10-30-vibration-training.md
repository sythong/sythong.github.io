## Acelerometer





## SAMPLING AND RESOLUTION
- Có 2 thông tin rule quan trọng:
    - Rule 1: Sample rate $f_s$ is controlled by maximum frequency (F_{max})
    - Rule 2: Number of the sample (N) is defined by the line of resolution (LOR)

### Sample Rate
- Rule1 : sample rate is proportional to frequency range:
    $$  F_s = 2.56 \times F_{max}$$
